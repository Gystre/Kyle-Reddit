# Kyle-Reddit

This project is a way for me to learn the full stack development experience, from server -> web -> domain registration -> vps -> deploy. Following Ben Awad's tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8) and building off of it. Sort of a spiritual successor to Kylegram. Super cool!!!
